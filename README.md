### The Data

Data Source: LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club

LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.

### Our Goal

Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), build a model that can predict wether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan? This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan.

### Project Overview

1. Performed exploratory data analysis 
2. Handled missing data and outliers
3. Feature engineering and conversion of categorical variables to dummy variables
4. Trained the data using Artificial Neural Network
